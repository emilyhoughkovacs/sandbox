### phrase.py
Original problem: For the two selections, given in Python syntax to be available as `mmg` and `geb`, make a three-word phrase entirely from words five letters or longer that occur in both selections.

_Text taken from Wikipdia pages [Major-General's Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General%27s_Song) and [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), with some characters converted to ASCII for convenience._

I adapted this problem to a function that would take any two phrase selections. In addition, you can create a phrase of any length. Possible ideas for the future:
* make `n` an optional argument (default to 3)
* make an optional argument for the length of the words
